# Flutter TODO App with Clean Architecture

Welcome to the **Flutter TODO App**! This project is a simple yet powerful example of a TODO application built with Flutter, featuring basic user authentication and task management functionalities. It utilizes Clean Architecture principles to ensure a well-organized and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Basic Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their sessions securely.
- **Tasks CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks with ease.
- **Clean Architecture**: The project adheres to Clean Architecture principles, providing a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several layers to separate concerns and facilitate clean coding practices. Here’s a brief overview of the structure:

- **Presentation Layer**: Contains the Flutter UI components and state management logic. This is where the app’s visual elements and user interactions are handled.

- **Domain Layer**: Defines the core business logic and entities. This layer is independent of any external libraries or frameworks and contains use cases that the presentation layer relies on.

- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources and implements repositories to handle data operations. This layer interacts with APIs, local databases, or any other data sources.
